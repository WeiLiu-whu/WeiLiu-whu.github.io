# BIO

Wei Liu is professor and director of the Department of Microelectronics at Wuhan University. His team is currently working on EDA technology, RISC-V chip design including analog and digital hybrid chip design and sensor chip design, AI accelerator and FPGA design and many other aspects. They have a lot of ongoing projects. Liu earned his doctorate in microelectronics from Wuhan University, and he was a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University(JHU) from 2015 to 2016.

Professor Liu has a wide range of research interests in digital chip design and integrated circuit processes including on-board intelligent chips, high frequency image processing chips, and AI accelerators with heterogeneous FPGA-CPU. He is involved in several ongoing projects in such areas as noval computer architecture for AI acceleration, analog and digital hybrid chip design, sensor chip design.

Additionally, The lab has a full set of authentic EDA design tools and software, a large server workstation, and can use a large computing center and a large GPU cluster!

**Professor Liu expected to recurit 1-2 students in the Fall 2023 admision cycle. If you are interested in working with Liu, feel free to reach out!**
